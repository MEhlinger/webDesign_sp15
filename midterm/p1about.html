				<h3>About Us</h3>
				So. For anyone who stumbles upon this unintentionally, this is a fake business. Also: nothing in here should be taken as serious instruction for rock climbing, hiking, or mountaineering. These are all potentially dangerous, potentially lethal activities. Most, if not all, of this information is accurate, but is no substitute for proper instruction and guidance. Please don't die out there. 
				<br>
				<h3>About The Project</h3>
				This website completed for Spring 2015 Web Development midterm. I chose to do an outdoor guide business.
				<br>
				The first step for creating the site was research. I checked out the websites for some other local guide services, which were, for the most part, pretty simplistic, spartan designs. Many were rather visually busy and poorly layed-out, but some- the simpler- were attractive, and featured many images of mountains, climbs, and the like.
				<br><br>

				The next step was to lay out the website. I storyboarded the template layout, designing based on the basic "box structure" layout with nested divs. I then outlined the five pages- the mandatory index/home, this about page, and three others, which I determined would be three different outdoor sport disciplines that I had experience with and could knowledgably write about: mountaineering, climbing, and trekking/hiking.
				<br><br>
				With the website roughly designed, I gather my images. The background image was a free photo from <a href="http://www.public-domain-photos.com">public-domain-photos.com</a>. The rest of the images were either taken by myself or my friend and climber partner Guille Metzler during our two-month climbing trip last year. I optimized all of those smaller photos with <a href="http://kraken.io">kraken.io</a>'s free web image optimization utility, and then shrunk them by percentage to fit them nicely in with the text.
				<br><br>
				Enjoy the site!
