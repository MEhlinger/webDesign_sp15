				Is your life dull, repetitive, and lacking in real excitement? Do you feel divorced from the animal struggle from which all humanity sprang forth? Do you even remember the last time you really walked the fine, beautiful line between safety and peril, between life and oblivion? Do you remember what it means to be <i> truly</i> alive?
				<br><br>
				If these questions hit close to your heart, <b>Mansfield MtnGuides</b> has the solution for your woes. Modern human life is frighteningly lacking in genuine stimulation. We believe that the best solution to that distinctively American brand of <i>ennui</i> is an adventurous voyage back into a beautiful, natural environment, combined with physical exertion and gratifying doses of self-reliance. All of this, of course, under the watchful guidance of somebody who actually knows what they're doing.

				Our qualified guides and instructors will help plan your excursion, provide any gear necessary, train you in the necessary and adequate skills, and accompany you into stark and beautiful environments. Visit remote vistas, craggy moonscapes, and secret pastoral valleys, all with our assistance. We offer a variety of styles of adventure, from relaxed getaway to one-day instructional clinics to extended expeditions into some of the most rugged climates on the planet. Nothing is out of the question, given enough determination. And money.
				<br><br>
				As the population of this great planet continues to swell exponentially like some sort of bloated dog carcass, eerily convulsing long after death as scavengers compete for ever-dwindling resources and space, it is more important than ever to get outside and take in everything the Earth has to offer. This stuff isn't going to be around forever, and neither are you. Outdoor adventure sports are fun, exciting, and immensely satisfying. They're a great way to get incredibly fit, and let's not gloss over the fact that they make you seem damn cool to people who don't do this kind of thing. Is there anything cooler than a mountain climber. No, except maybe an astronaut, but I mean come on, you gave up on that dream in the fifth grade when you got glasses. Time to move on. Everest is pretty much off the planet, anyway.
