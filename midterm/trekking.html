				Sometimes, you want to give your arms a break from all the rock, ice, and snow climbing, and just let them swing idly at your side like some sort of carefree sasquatch. We can help. Grab your backpack (or rent gear from us), pack up a tent, sleeping bag, and stove, and hit the trail. Mansfield MtnGuides offers guided dayhikes and backpacking trips from 1 to >1 days, in any locale on this great earth. 
				<br><br>
				Meander along scenic coastal trails in the Pacific Northwest. Slog up Mt. Whitney, the tallest mountain in the lower 48. Climb Kilimanjaro, the tallest mountain in all of Africa. Hike scenic, rural pathways through Italy, France, and Switzerland. Walk to the north pole on a frozen sea using nordic skis (limited time only- it's melting!). The choice is entirely yours.
				<br><br>
				We'll work with you to determin a level of difficulty that will be manageable and safe, while giving you the challenge you're looking for. Hiking can be a spiritually satisfying, challenging activity that you can continue to participate in for the rest of your life. Trekking means different things to different people, from summiting massive, yet non-technical mountains, to hiking gently rolling hills or beaches for miles upon miles.
				<br><br>
				Get in touch with Mansfield MtnGuides today and begin to wander this great Earth of ours.
