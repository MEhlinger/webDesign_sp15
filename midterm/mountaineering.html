				<h3>Mountaineering</h3>
				<b>Mountaineering</b> is the act of climbing mountains! "But Mansfield MtnGuides," you say, "if I walk up a mountain on a gently sloping trail, is that mountaineering? And what if I climb up a long, difficult rock or ice route to get to the summit?""
				<br><br>
				Truthfully, the definition of mountaineering is a bit vague. Here at Mansfield MtnGuides, we define Mountaineering, as opposed to Rock Climbing and Trekking, as: <b><i>"climbing a mountain such that the objective hazards, such as weather, rockfall, and altitude, are a more significant obstacle than subjective technical difficulty."</b></i>
				<br><br>
				Mountaineering can vary wildly in terms of difficulty and danger, as well as technical complexity. Hard mountain trekking blurs into less complex mountaineering. Some good beginner peaks for those looking for a genuine challenge include the Adirondacks, the Green Mountains of Vermont in winter, and the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Going further, the Rocky Mountains offer some easier ascents, as well as some significant challenges. 
				<br><br>
				Some of the most popular ascents in the U.S. include Mt. Whitney, Mt. Hood, and Mt.Ranier. Denali (a.k.a. Mt. McKinley) in Alaska is both the tallest mountain in North America, and one of the most challenging. Overseas, options include Patagonia in South America, the Swiss Alps, and the Himilayas. 
 				<br><br>
				Mountaineering is a serious endeavor, and generally represents very real danger. Let Mansfield MtnGuides help you approach the high country as safely as possible, and reap some of the most deeply rewarding experiences of your life.
