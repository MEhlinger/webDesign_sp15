				<h3>Rock Climbing</h3>

				<b>Rock Climbing</b> is the act of scaling stone faces of any height with the use of hands, feet, and sometimes equipment bolted to, hammered in, or temporarily affixed to the rock. This includes the disciplines of bouldering, traditional free climbing, sport climbing, aid climbing, big wall, and even <i>free soloing</i> without any ropes or protection whatsoever! We offer guide service for all of the aforementioned disicplines, for one-day or multiday excursions, and for clients of every skill level from beginner to expert stonemaster!
				<br><br>
				<i>Bouldering</i> is unroped climbing on shorter cliffs or freestanding boulders. The boulderer generally uses only chalk and climbing shoes to aid his or her ascent, and climbs over foam pads as protection. Bouldering is generally much more difficult than many forms of comparable roped climbing, due to generally shorter climbs and potentially less dramatic falls- though some boulderers climb high enough that they'd suffer serious consequence in the event of a fall! A bouldering route is called a <i>problem</i>.

				<i>Traditional Climbing</i> is climbing from the ground-up using a rope, where the leading climber places pieces of (generally removable) protection into cracks in the rock to (hopefully) hold them in the event of a fall. <i>Sport Climbing</i> is similar, but the leader clips into pre-placed bolt hangers, bolted securely into a rock face. Generally sport climbing allows for safer attempts on more difficult climbs that might necessitate many falls as the climber works on a project route, whereas traditional climbing allows for adventurous climbing anywhere where protection can be placed. Trad climbing, sport climbing, and bouldering are all forms of <i>free climbing</i>, because the climber holds directly onto the rock, and does not pull/stand on any metal/nylon gear during the ascent.
				<br><br>
				<i>Aid Climbing</i>, as opposed to free climbing, is when the climber steps into nylon "ladders" and pulls on pieces of gear place on the wall. It is similar to traditional climbing, but makes use of gear and techniques that are designed to hold only bodyweight, not the huge amount of force generated in a dynamic fall. Aid climbers don't intend to fall often/at all, and this style is ideal for climbing barely-featured faces that would be phenomenally difficult to impossible to free climb. Aid is often used in the ascent of huge multipitch walls, such as El Cap in Yosemite!
				<br><br>
				We'll take you climbing in the style of your choice, in the locale of your choice! Whether it be the red sandstone of the southeast, the world-famous granite of the west coast, or the rugged alpine rock of the Rocky Mountains, Mansfield MtnGuids is there, helping you not die!
